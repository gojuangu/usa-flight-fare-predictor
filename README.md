# US Flight Fare Predictor

You will be able to get the average price for a plane ticket between two american cities. 

The first time you have to download all the date from the 'The Airline Origin and Destination Survey ([DB1B](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/)) which is a "10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers collected by the Office of Airline Information of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics". Once a prediction is made you could choose two cities (using the airport codes) to get the price in dollars.

You can find all the list of american airports [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States). Please, use the IATA codes.
