# Flight Ticket Predictor

The following project README file describes the essence of the project playing the most important role. 

## **USA Aviation Industry**
United States has one the largest air travel market of any single country, with nearly 45,000 daily flights, flying 2,900,000 passaners everyday in and out of american airports. The industry contributed to the 5.2% of GDP. Therefore, given the massive extension of the country (9,826,675 km²) domestic flights are a great deal. 

According to the current National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS), there are over 19,600 airports. Noting that the term “airport” includes landing areas developed for conventional fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and seaplanes.. 5,038 of these airports are open to the general public and 503 of them serve commercial flights.

## **Project Methodoly**
To develop the project I've used 'The Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B)' whihc is a "10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers collected by the Office of Airline Information of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics."

The survey is divided into three categories: DB1B Coupon, DB1B Ticket and DB1B, but only two have been utilized: 

DB1BCoupon - This table provides coupon-specific information for each domestic itinerary of the Origin and Destination Survey, such as the operating carrier, origin and destination airports, number of passengers, fare class, coupon type, trip break indicator, and distance.

DB1BTicket - This table contains summary characteristics of each domestic itinerary on the Origin and Destination Survey, including the reporting carrier, itinerary fare, number of passengers, originating airport, roundtrip indicator, and miles flown.
